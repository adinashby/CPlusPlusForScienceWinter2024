# 1. Introduction to Computers and Programming

## 1. What is a Computer?

- Computer – programmable machine designed to follow instructions

- Computers can do such a wide variety of things because they can be programmed. This means computers are designed to do any job that their programs tell them to do

- The uses of computers are almost limitless in our everyday lives

- In school, students use computers for tasks such as writing papers, searching for articles, sending e-mail, and participating in online classes

- At work, people use computers to conduct business transactions, communicate with customers and coworkers, analyze data, make presentations, control machines in manufacturing facilities, and many other tasks

- At home, people use computers for tasks such as paying bills, shopping online, social networking, and playing computer games

## 2. Why Program?

- **Program** – set of instructions in computer memory to make it do something

- Programs are commonly referred to as **software**. Software is essential to a computer because without software, a computer can do nothing.

- **Programmer** (software developer) – person who writes instructions (programs) to make computer perform a task
- a person with the training and skills necessary to design, create, and test computer programs.

- So, without programmers, no programs; without programs, a computer cannot do anything

## 3. Computer Systems

- Computer systems consist of two main components:

- Hardware devices and
- Software components

### 3.1. Computer Hardware Component Categories

- Hardware refers to the physical components of which a computer is made. A computer is not an individual device, but a system of devices.

- A typical computer system consists of the following major hardware components:

1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
2. Main Memory
3. Secondary Memory / Storage
4. Input Devices
5. Output Devices
